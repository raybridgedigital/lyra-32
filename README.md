# LYRA-32 Mk II

Hybrid polyphonic web synthesizer by [Raybridge Digital](https://github.com/raybridgedigital).

Play from a class-compliant USB-C MIDI keyboard, the computer keys (A–L), or the on-screen piano. Chrome / Edge / Firefox.

## Mk II

- Dual LFO (cutoff, pitch, pan, amp, resonance, FM)
- 4-slot modulation matrix (LFO1/2, filter EG, velocity, mod wheel)
- Ring mod, analog-style sync, oscillator drift
- Wavetable (Table) oscillator + notch filter + velocity to cutoff
- FX rack: chorus, delay, reverb, phaser
- 32-voice polyphony
- Hide the on-screen keyboard for hardware MIDI (M-Audio etc.)
- Three-column panel layout
- 145 factory patches in banks (incl. Techno)

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the app, press a piano key or A–L. The first keystroke unlocks audio (browser policy).

USB MIDI: plug in a class-compliant keyboard, allow MIDI when prompted. Safari does not support Web MIDI. Use the keyboard icon in the header to hide the on-screen piano.
